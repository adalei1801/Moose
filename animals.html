   <h1>Moose Information</h1>
    <p>
    According to Wikipedia, "the moose or elk is a member of the New World deer subfamily and is the largest and heaviest extant species in the deer family. Most adult male moose have distinctive broad, palmate antlers; most other members of the deer family have antlers with a dendritic configuration"

     Moose are typically non aggressive towards humans when unprovoked. When provoked as moose has several tells to signal attack. One of these is if a moose stops chewing its food and stres at you. Moose attacks can often be deadly as they tend to use their antlers to toss things into the air and procede to stomp the source of disturbance with their hooves and stop for small breaks. The the target is still moving they will keep this up for as long as necessary. A way to avoid this is to move out of sight and if that isn't possible then curl into a ball and protect your head and torso and don't move even if the moose stops.
